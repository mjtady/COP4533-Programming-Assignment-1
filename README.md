# COP4533-Programming-Assignment-1
# Group: Cesar Gonzales (UFID: 16089812) and Maria Juliana Tady (UFID: 99152158)
# C++ was used for better scalibility and the C++ STL data structures

# The files are :
# matcher.cpp (Task A), verifier.cpp (Task B), example.in and example.out (expected inpout and output files), plot.py (graph generation), and main.cpp (scalability test)

# Part C : We used a python script to make a graph out of the .csv output file from main.cpp
# To generate the graph, run the scalability tester, and run the plot.py to generate the graph.
